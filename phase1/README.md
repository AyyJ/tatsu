 * The shopping cart is session-scoped and will not be remembered across multiple visits.

 * If the price changes between the time a user adds an item to the shopping cart and the time it is displayed on
  the cart, the displayed price will be the current (updated) price of the product.

* The user names and searches are both case sensitive.
